# CplusplusProgram

This program allows users to see how their investments will grow over time based on initial deposit, if they contribute monthly, and interest rate.
I believe the overall style and naming convention is well done. Easy to read with comments. Created a class and used functions to try to keep main as clean as possible 
One thing I could have improved on was to have input validation for characters and negative numbers. This would keep the user from entering a wrong input.
This was the first time using OOP in c++ so it was the most challenging part of this program. Sometimes got confusing of what should go into savings.cpp and savings.h. Overcame this by looking at examples and using the text book.
The use of OOP and trying to use it more frequently will be helpful for other projects
It is maintainable because everything is in either it's own file or function and can be easily changed which also makes the program adaptable. I also put in comments to keep the code readable.
